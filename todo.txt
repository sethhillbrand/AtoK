1) Truetype text needs shifting up in the Y direction a bit

2) Text within components not rotated correctly

3) LCD display not right probably cos it's on bottom layer LAYER= not available in the Models6 data.dat

4) shape based models needs sorting e.g. U4

5) 3D can't handle components with models on both sides of board
